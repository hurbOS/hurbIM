[Pre Apr 26, --:--]
 - Npyscreen main page - Contact list, Message output and Message input.
 - Contacts database system (sqlite3)
 - Simple local socket server (to be hosted on domain later)
 - Welcome screen for client

[Sun Apr 26, 18:02]
 - You can now connect to the server script, although it is not running on our domain yet.
 - There is now the beginning of server authentication, though proper user accounts will come later.
 - Using the npyscreen tui, it is possible to send messages to the server through ports, which are then logged in a database.
 - All the client side and server side code has been cleaned up and compartmentalised into more several more files.

[Mon Apr 27, 00:10]
 - Relatively good server authentication: must have matching password and username to one in database(still needs work).
 - Several users can connect and disconnect without trouble.
 - Improved message sending, uses string maniulation to send all informaton in one string.
 - Database improvements - uses sender and reciever data to select specific database records to return.

[Wed Apr 29, 23:01]
 - Finally created server side message output, using str() and lots of luck.
 - Begun client side message output though it may need speed improvements eventually.
 - 'Cleanup' and 'bugfixes'

[Sat May 02, 22:55]
 - (Limited) client/server interfacing improvements - currently saves messages to text file but changing to db.
 - First message where it was sent from npyscreen client, recieived by server and echoed back to the client.
 - Local message storage with YET ANOTHER sqlite database (I am now officially addicted to them).

[Sun May 03, 16:38]
 - (Very janky) but now messages are all stored in a db including ones sent by server.
 - It IS possible to communicate between two clients now but so much work on accounts needs to be done (also domain)
 - Minorly improved some code, made other bits shocking.

[Mon May 04, 23:48]
 - Started picotui tui, soon to replace npyscreen, because
   - Man, screw Npyscreen;
   - Less code, lighter code;
   - It will be more suckless code (minimalism, yay!).
 - Picotui will be styled as a mutt/ranger interface with vim bindings, for an EXTREME linux experience.

[Wed May 06, 23:14]
 - Picotui was also a bust, however pure curses in python rocks.
 - Much easier, faster and more efficent code structure.
 - Redesigning with terminal like structure rather than just input.
 - Original npyscreen is obsolete now, so don't work on it but don't delete it yet either.

[Thu Jun 04, 18:35]
 - Finished off some tuff in the python client.
 - Another redesign: changing language to rust (for the moment).
 - Two new application modes: GUI and TUI.
 - New backend: modified discord with modifications, no electron for a lighweight program.
 - We welcome Fark to the team!
