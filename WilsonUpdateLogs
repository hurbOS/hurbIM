 - You can now connect to the server script, although it is not running on our domain yet.
 - There is now the beginning of server authentication, though proper user accounts will come later.
 - Using the npyscreen tui, it is possible to send messages to the server through ports, which are then logged in a database.
 - All the client side and server side code has been cleaned up and compartmentalised into more several more files.

 - Relatively good server authentication: must have matching password and username to one in database(still needs work).
 - Several users can connect and disconnect without trouble.
 - Improved message sending, uses string maniulation to send all informaton in one string.
 - Database improvements - uses sender and reciever data to select specific database records to return.

[Wed Apr 29, 23:01]
 - Finally created server side message output, using str() and some luck.
 - Begun client side message output though it may need speed improvements eventually.
 - Cleanup and bugfixes
