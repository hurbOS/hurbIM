- Minimal (TUI)
    - Working on login screen
    - Minor changes to client

**Note to fellow contributers:** <br>
        If you're seeing this, we need to consider using OOP for the minimal TUI. 
        Each Screen needs it's own class so that we can just import when we need it.
        Idk about you guys but labels are complete shit so if you need one, 
        just use d.add(x, y, "whatever text") and it will convert automatically. For example:

        d.add(mid_x-15, 12, "Username:")
